# Quadratic Function Analysis

This Python program analyzes a quadratic function, computes derivatives, identifies critical points, and visualizes the function.

## Tasks

### 1. Dynamic Function for Derivative Calculation

- Create a Python function `dy_dx` that calculates the derivative of any given function with respect to a variable `x`.
- The function should take an input function `f(x)` as a string and return its derivative.
- Utilize SymPy or other suitable libraries for symbolic differentiation.

### 2. Test the Derivative Function with a Quadratic Equation

- Define a quadratic equation of your choice that has at least two minima and two maxima.
- Test the `dy_dx` function created in Task 1 with this quadratic equation to verify its correctness.

### 3. Plot the Graph of the Quadratic Equation

- Implement code to visualize the quadratic equation defined in Task 2.
- Use Matplotlib or other plotting libraries to create a graph of the quadratic function.

### 4. Identify Minima and Maxima

- Create separate arrays to store the x-values of minima and maxima of the quadratic function.
- Print these arrays to display the critical points of the function.

### 5. Compute Global Minima and Maxima

- Determine the global minima and maxima of the quadratic function.
- Print the coordinates of these points to identify the overall minimum and maximum values of the function.

### 6. Visualize the Global Minima and Maxima

- Plot the graph of the quadratic function along with markers indicating the global minima and maxima.
- Ensure that the markers are visually distinguishable on the graph.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `quadratic_function_analysis.ipynb`.
3. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
